````Java

import java.lang.*;

public class MyFirst {

    public static void main(String arg[]) {
       System.out.println("Hello World");
       System.out.println(arg[0]);
    }
    
}
# public: if you want this method to be accessed from anywhere use public
# static: if we want to use anything from the class without creating an object, we use static. It is just like the concept of "static" in Swift when we work with "Struct".
# if it is static we can execute just by using the class name.
# void: it is a return type; since we don't return anything we use void
# main: is a method
# (String arg[]): it is command line argument; In Java, though we use it or not, we must have it

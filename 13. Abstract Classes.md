There are two type of classes: 
- Abstract Class: you can create object of Abstract Class, but you can create a reference from abstract class
- Concrete Class: Create object 


- Abstract Method: if a class have at least one Abstract Method, then it is an Abstract Class
- Note: if any class inherit from Abstract Class, that class will become an Abstract Class too. To make it become Concrete Class, </br> we must override the Abstruct Method.

- We use Abstract when we want to impose standards to something. Ex: I want to open MyHospital, I need to comply to the Hospital standard

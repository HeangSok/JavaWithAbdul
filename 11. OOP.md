Principles of OOP:
- Abstraction  // means hiding internal details and showing only required features. You don't have to know what it is in the method; just use it. Ex: .length(), .System.util.sort(str)
- Encapsulation // everything is in a sigle capsule
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism // can be achieved via **overloading** and **override**; **Poly** means many; **morphism** means form

Type of Poroperties:
- Read & Writeable
- Read Only // like getter in Swift
- Write Only // like setter in Swift

**Constructor** is a method of a class whci is caleed automatically whenever your are creatign an object. </br> 
In Java, constructor has a name like the class. Ex: if the class name Retangle, the construtor is Rectagle too.

There are two type of **Constructor**:
- with parameter
- without parameter and has its default value

**Note**: there is no return type in _Constructor_.

Example:

````Java
class Rectangle
{
  private double length;
  private double breadth;

pulbic Rectangle() // it is a constructor with default value; note that it is doesn't have a return type
{
  lenght=1;
  breadth=1;
}

public Rectangle(double l, double b)
{
  lenght=l;
  breadth=b;
}
public Rectangle(double s)
{
  lenght=breadth=s;
}
// we have three constructors in this class

}
//----------------let's write down our applicattion class

public class RectangleTest
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  Rectangle r=new Retangle();
}
}

````

**Compiler vs Interpreter**:

_Interpreter:_
- doesn't create a new file
- need an interpreter to execute it each time line by line. ex: JavaScript needs browser to be executed
- the interpretation will stop where errors occured


_Compiler:_
- create a new compiled file that contains **Machine Code**. Ex: C++ compiled file is **Something.exe** and Java Compiled file is **Something.class**
- In C++, you can execute the compiled file directly while in Python or JavaScript you need to interprete first and then execute line by line. That is why the C++ is faster
- the compilation will stop immediately where there is an errors

**Java** is a **Hybrid Language** because it compiles to **byte code** first then interprete to **machine code** using **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine).

ðŸ‘‰ Once you compile Java **Source Code** to **Byte Code**, can run it on any plateform (Window, Mac, Linux). </br>
ðŸ‘‰ Java is type of language that you Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
ðŸ‘‰ If you compile a C++ **Source Code** on **Window**, you can't run it on **Mac**
ðŸ‘‰ If you compile a Java **Source Code** on **Window**, you can run it on any platform.
